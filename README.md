  ## Description
  <p>âš¡Here Simulate Vehicle Direction sign as when driver want turn right press on Right indicator and can give left indicator and can give wait sign </p>
  <p>âš¡This System work in AVR atmega32 and use FreeRTOS and Apply Finite State machine and Periodic Polling </p>
  <p>âš¡Polling has High priority  as every specofoc time check pressed button and store in state and then state machine called and handle state and control led intensity using PWM </p>

</p>

## IDE
 <p>âš¡IDE are Eclipse (Atmel studio to upload code to MCU) & Proteus</p>
 
 
##Demo 

### Waiting 
<p> âš¡Waiting indicator make Right and Left Led high for 500ms and low for 500ms and during 500ms High led on with specific intensity that was setten  in fast PWM </p>
<p> âš¡ Waiting work If engine power on/off</p>
